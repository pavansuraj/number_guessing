### Documentation:
#### Design Choices:
   a. **Scoped Random Number Generation:**
      - Moved the random number generation inside the `pick()` function to provide a new number for each game.
   b. **Formatted Strings:**
      - Used formatted strings (f-strings) for better readability.
   c. **Improved Variable Naming:**
      - Changed variable names to follow the snake_case convention.
   d. **Simplified Play Again Check:**
      - Simplified the play again check by using `lower()` and a list of valid choices.
#### Challenges Faced:
   a. **Scope of Variables:**
      - Ensuring that the `name` variable is accessible in both the `intro()` and `pick()` functions.
   b. **Number Range Validation:**
      - Checking if the player's guess is within the specified range.
### Testing:
Thoroughly test the code by running various scenarios:
   - Entering valid guesses.
   - Entering invalid guesses.
   - Playing multiple times.
Fix any identified bugs or issues during testing.
### Conclusion:
The implemented code adheres to best coding practices, readability, and improved functionality. This documentation provides insights into design choices, challenges faced, and the rationale behind the code structure. Please test the code in your Python environment and let me know if you encounter any issues or have further questions.
